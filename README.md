# COVID-19_Project
## Summary
In this project, I collaborated with a group to model and analyze the temporal evolution of COVID-19 cases using techniques of Data Science such as Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, PCA, and training several prediction models (Random Forrest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbor). As result, we were able to predict a counties' political preference with 90% accuracy.

### Description of covid_partt1.ipynb
- Investigated COVID-19 data in the years 2020-2021. This data contains information about COVID-19 case counts, mortalities, vaccination rates, and various other metadata that can assist in modeling various aspects of COVID-19. In this part we demonstrated our knowledge of Data cleaning and EDA using Pandas, unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, and visualization practices. 
NOTE: Towards the end of the file, we developed a hypothesis that involved predicting a state's political preference with attributes that describe the severity of precautions taken against COVID-19. This is further explored in covid_part2.ipynb.

### Description of covid_partt2.ipynb
- Revised original hypothesis to predicting a state's political preference to predicting a counties' political preference with attributes that describe the severity of precautions taken against COVID-19. We demonstrated the use of training and testing models like Radom Forrest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors and more. In addition, we also used Feature Engineering to increase the accuracy of our best model.

### Description of Project Report
- This is a report that investigates our revised hypothesis we developed for covid_part2.ipynb. This report outlines the the steps we took in covid_part2.ipynb from Data Cleaning all the way to training models in order to determine whether a counties' political preference is able to be predicted given attributes that describe the severity of precautions taken against COVID-19.
